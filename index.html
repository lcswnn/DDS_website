                "Dr. Garrison is not only extremely talented as a medical professional, she is one of the kindest and most compassionate people you will ever meet. She has treated my entire family (even 3 teenagers - yikes!) for many years now, and I fully trust her opinion and skills. She cared for all 3 of my kids prior to, during and now after braces; and has now seen 2 of the 3 before and after having their wisdom teeth removed. Dr. Garrison will never recommend procedures she doesn't fully believe in or think are required. If you're looking for a family dentist, Dr. Garrison should be at the top of your list!"

                "Dr Garrison is a wonderful dentist that has been treating my family and I for many years! We moved out of the area several years ago but we still continue to visit Dr Garrison for our 6-month checkups since she knows our family history. She is an extremely kind, intelligent dentist who listens and takes care of all of my family dental needs."

I continue to be extremely impressed with her staff as well. They are very welcoming and are always eager to help in any way that they can. I have brought both of my teenage daughters here and they love Dr. Garrison and the team as well. We will all continue to return."

I first came in after not having dental insurance for a while, and it had been years since my last dentist visit, and they did a consultation visit to see what needed to be done. They made what is normally an unpleasant experience (cavities and crowns) quick and painless."
